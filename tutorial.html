							<h2>Tutorials and Resources for OS Algorithms</h2>
							<p>Operating Systems has various algorithms which are used to schedule the processes on the processor in an efficient way and test all the requests made by processes for resources. In this section, we've compiled brief tutorials and resources for getting started with various algorithms in Operating Systems.</p>

						<br>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/tutorial-pic01.png" alt="" /></span>CPU Scheduling is a process of determining which process will own CPU for execution while another process is on hold. The main task of CPU scheduling is to make sure that whenever the CPU remains idle, the OS at least select one of the processes available in the ready queue for execution. The selection process will be carried out by the CPU scheduler. It selects one of the processes in memory that are ready for execution.</p>

									<h3 align="center">Disk Scheduling Algorithms</h3>
									<br>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/tutorial-pic02.png" alt="" /></span>Disk scheduling is done by operating systems to schedule I/O requests arriving for the disk. Disk scheduling is also known as I/O scheduling. Disk scheduling is important since multiple I/O requests may arrive by different processes and only one I/O request can be served at a time by the disk controller. Thus other I/O requests need to wait in the waiting queue and need to be scheduled.</p>

		                     <li>Disk Access Time = Rotational Latency + Seek Time + Transfer Time </li>

									<h3 align="center">Page Replacement Algorithms</h3>
									<br>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/tutorial-pic03.png" alt="" /></span>In an operating system that uses paging for memory management, a page replacement algorithm is needed to decide which page needs to be replaced when new page comes in. The process of replacement is sometimes called swap out or write to disk. Page replacement is done when the requested page is not found in the main memory (page fault). The various page replacement algorithms like FIFO, Optimal page replacement, LRU, LIFO, and Random page replacement help the operating system to decide which page to replace.</p>
							<div class="row">
								<div class="row-6 row-12-mobilep">
									<h4><b>Important Terminologies</b></h4>
									<p><ol><li>Page Fault: A page fault is an interruption that occurs when a software program attempts to access a memory block not currently stored in the system's RAM. The page fault is also called page miss. </li> <li>Page Hit: When we want to load the page on the memory, and the page is already available on memory, then it is called page hit. </li><li>Page Fault Rate: A page fault will occur for every certain amount of main memory access,which is called page fault rate. </li> <li>Page Hit Rate: The percentage of times that a particular page number is found in the TLB is called the Page hit ratio. </li></ol></p>

									<h3 align="center">Deadlock Avoidance Algorithm</h3>
									<br>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/tutorial-pic04.png" alt="" /></span>The deadlock avoidance method is used by the operating system in order to check whether the system is in a safe state or in an unsafe state and in order to avoid the deadlocks, the process must need to tell the operating system about the maximum number of resources a process can request in order to complete its execution. Banker's algorithm is used to avoid deadlock and allocate resources safely to each process in the computer system. It also helps the operating system to successfully share the resources between all the processes.</p>
							<div class="row">

									<h3 align="center">Memory Allocation Techniques</h3>
									<br>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/tutorial-pic05.png" alt="" /></span>Memory allocation is the process of assigning blocks of memory on request. Typically the allocator receives memory from the operating system in a small number of large blocks that it must divide up to satisfy the requests for smaller blocks. It must also make any returned blocks available for reuse. There are many common ways to perform this, with different strengths and weaknesses. A few of them are: First Fit, Worst Fit, Best Fit. These techniques can often be used in combination.</p>
							<div class="row">
								<div class="row-6 row-12-mobilep">
									<h4><b>Important Terminologies</b></h4>
									<p><ol><li>Static Memory Allocation: The program is allocated memory at compile time. </li> <li>Dynamic Memory Allocation: The programs are allocated with memory at run time. </li><li>Best Fit: Deals with allocating the smallest free partition which meets the requirement of the requesting process. </li> <li>First Fit: The pointer keeps track of all the free blocks in the memory and accepts the request of allocating a memory block to the coming process. </li> <li>Worst Fit: Allocates a process to the partition which is largest sufficient among the freely available partitions available in the main memory. </li></ol></p>
